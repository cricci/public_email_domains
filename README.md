# What is this?
A list of public (personal, not disposable) email domains. There are several sources for disposable domains, which have satisfied my needs to-date. If you're looking for something like that, Google and github are your friends.

## What are the files?
* The *-ALL* file has every domain I've found to-date (i.e. for scrubbing an existing list)
* The *-WORKING* file has a list of domains that have working MX entry(ies) in DNS, thus they appear to support email delivery (i.e. for preventing inclusion, filtering from forms or imports, etc.)
* The *ipynb* is a Jupyter notebook with code I used to validate the -WORKING domains.
* The *csv* is the output from this Jupyter notebook, and for further analysis.

## Why?
For an assortment of projects, I needed to flag these email addresses for exclusion in campaigns.
