# What is this?
A list of public (personal, not disposable) email domains. I already have a consolidated list of disposable domains, and there seem to be a lot of good sources for the same online.

For an assortment of projects, I need(ed) to flag personal email accounts for exclusion and amendment in order to support B2B marketing activities.

If there is sufficient (read: any) interest, I will add support for external contributions.

# Todos:
* Add various rr.com domains, or wildcard the same.
