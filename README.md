# What is this?
A list of public (personal, not disposable) email domains. There are several sources for disposable domains, which have satisfied my needs to-date. Google and github are your friends.

However, for an assortment of projects, I needed to flag personal email accounts for exclusion from campaigns, or amendments/augmentation in order to support B2B marketing activities. Mainly these are free or low-cost services offering mainly personal email addresses.

If there is sufficient (read: any) interest, I will add support for external contributions.

# Todos:
* Add various rr.com domains, or wildcard the same.
